# Sushiswap Fork changes - ASAP 

Our token is pegged with USDC on Matic/BSC/ETH networks. We wrote a script so that people can buy with any token through the uniswapv2 router. https://tinyurl.com/yr65rs5n however we need it implemented in the sushiswap UI fork we made.

There's 5 different use cases we can discuss.

Review the code, and let me know if you can assist us in implementation.
